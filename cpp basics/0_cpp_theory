C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming.

Our C++ tutorial includes all topics of C++ such as first example, control statements, objects and classes, inheritance, constructor, destructor, this, static, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, encapsulation, arrays, strings, exception handling, File IO, etc.

What is C++
C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object-oriented programming (OOPs) used in C++ are:

Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction

C++ Standard Libraries
Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:

The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.

Usage of C++
By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

Window application
Client-Server application
Device drivers
Embedded firmware etc
